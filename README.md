# Author-Books-CRUD-API

The CRUD TypeScript Express API for Authors and Books allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, 
Update, and Delete) operations on a database that contains information about authors and their books.

The API is built using the Express.js framework, which provides an easy-to-use, 
lightweight web application infrastructure for creating APIs. TypeScript is used to provide a
statically-typed syntax for building the API, making it easier to maintain and debug.

The API allows users to create new authors and books, retrieve information about existing authors and books,
update the details of authors and books, and delete authors and books from the database. Users can also perform 
advanced queries to retrieve information about authors and books based on specific criteria.
